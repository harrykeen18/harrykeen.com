I'm addicted to Claude Code.

I feel like I’ve got a superpower when I’m using it, I turn it on and I can pour weeks worth of work in to a furious few hours. I actually complete side projects because tough challenges that needed serious thinking time I just didn’t have, can be overcome with a few prompts. My mental model for what’s possible has totally shifted.

They say developers are losing their craft, losing the joy of juggling bits to control silicon. But honestly, I’m all for this new high octane era. I don’t feel like I lose satisfaction, in fact I get MORE satisfaction from powering through more. MORE. MORE. MORE! Typos? Who cares. The model deals with it. Properly explaining every detail? No need. My buddy Claude just get’s me, knows what I’m about to say before I say it. Just hit enter and get the prompt OUT.

I’ve got the pro tier. $20 per month. I want more than it gives me though, I really do. My god I’m tempted to upgrade to the $100, the only thing holding me back is the enforced half day and weekly limits that actually manage my cravings just a little bit. If I had 5 times more usage from the next tier, god dammit I would use it. But at what cost? Would I have time to parent, exercise, be a good husband, do my actual job? I doubt it, I really doubt it.

Please Anthropic, don’t give me more for my family’s sake.
